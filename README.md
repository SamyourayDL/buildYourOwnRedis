# [Build Your Own Redis with C/C++](https://build-your-own.org/redis/)
## Goals
- Understand the architecture and core concepts of Redis
- Improve skills in network programming
- Gain a low-level understanding of concurrent I/O models
- Build a complete low-level project from the ground up (0 to 100)

| Introduction              | ‚úÖ      | What is Redis and its key concepts                                                            |
| Socket Programming        | ‚úÖ      | Linux scoket API: `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()` –∏ `accept()`                |
| TCP Server and Client     | ‚úÖ      | Simple client-server on top of sockets(TCP)                           |
| Request-Response Protocol | ‚úÖ      | Application-level network protocol. Parse the stream of bytes into data.             |
| Concurrent IO Models      | ‚úÖ      | **Event-loop + poll + non-blocking `read()/write()`** vs Thread-based concurrency   |
| Event Loop (Part 1)       | ‚úÖ      | Event-loop realisation based on `poll()`.                                               |
| Event Loop (Part 2)       | ‚úÖ     | Pipelined-requests optimisation + optimistyc `write() `                   |
| Key-Value Server          | üîú       | Finalization of client-server model                             |
| Hashtables (Part 1)       | ‚ùå      |                                  |
| Hashtables (Part 2)       | ‚ùå      |                                       |
